Salvatore is a bioinformatic researcher and computational biologist. His scientific interests gravitate around cancer genomics, biomedicine, machine learning and complex systems.  
He grew up in southern Italy where he studied Biology and obtained his PhD at the University of Messina. After that he moved to Verona in the Functional Genomics Lab of Prof. Massimo Delledonne and then he joined the "DDC - DNA Damage in Cancer" team led by Dr. Balca Mardin at BioMed X Institute in Heidelberg, Germany. As postdoc in the Hovestadt Lab at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute he works at the intersection of (explainable) artificial intelligence and cancer research, developing interpretable machine learning models to foster the next generation of AI-powered cancer diagnostics.
